# Pipex

Welcome to the Pipex project!

Pipex is a command-line utility that allows you to simulate the functionality of the shell pipe (`|`) operator in Unix-like systems. It is designed to take two commands as input and redirect the output of the first command as the input to the second command.

This project is part of the curriculum at 42 school, where students learn about Unix system calls, file descriptors, and process management. By completing this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of how pipes work and how to manipulate file descriptors in a Unix environment.

I encourage you to explore the code, experiment with different commands, and enhance the functionality of Pipex as you see fit!

i tried to arrange the code as readable as possible, as well as separating the actual handling from the "utils" that are snippets of code
more "general" that could be used in other projects aswell.

Happy piping!
